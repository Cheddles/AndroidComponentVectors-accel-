AndroidComponentVectors-accel-
==============================

A lightweight app to visualise the total acceleration parallel to the screen then display arrows and values for the total vector and each orthogonal component.

The acceleration is the acceleration on the device due to the applied force. For a stationary device, this is the upward force opposing gravity. As the device is tilted, the acceleration vector will point uphill.
